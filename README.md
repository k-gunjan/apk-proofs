# Fully Succinct BLS Signature Aggregation

Individual BLS signatures on the same message can be aggregated into a single signature
that can be verified in constant time, given the verifier knows the aggregate public key of the set of the actual signers [[1]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/483). 
However, computing the aggregate public key is linear in the number of the actual signers and requires the verifier to know the individual public keys.

We avoid such heavy computation for verifiers that are constrained resource-wise and computation-wise (e.g., mobile phones, smart contracts on  blockchains) by designing custom non-interactive succinct arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) that compute and ensure the correctness of an apk, i.e., an aggregated public key of actual signers. This repo contains PoC implementations as well as formalisations for our custom SNARKs for apk, given the verifier knows only a commitment to the list of public keys of all the eligible signers and a bitmask identifying the actual signers of a message.

See the light-client simulation in [bw6/examples](bw6/examples/README.md) for a sketch of a blockchain light client design exploiting such proofs.

Two configurations are implemented: BLS12-377 signatures with proofs over BW6-761 (`Apk377`), and BLS12-381 signatures with proofs over BW6-767 (`Apk381`). The 'packed' scheme is available on the first only.

# Formal Write-up
The formal description and security model for our custom succinct arguments as well as their application to accountable light clients for PoS blockchains can be found [here/stable version](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1205) and [here/on-going updates](https://github.com/w3f/apk-proofs/blob/main/Light%20Client.pdf). A high-level summary of this work as well as its connection with related reseach effort from the Web3 Foundation can be found [here](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/LightClientsBridges/index.html).

# How to Reproduce Results in the Formal Write-up

1. [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust toolchain.
2. Run one of the commands below from the `bw6` directory.

The argument is the number of validators. The write-up's results are for domains of size 2^10, 2^16 and 2^20, which on BLS12-377/BW6-761 means 2^k - 1 validators (one row of the domain is reserved for the accumulator's initial value).

#### Basic Accountable Scheme 
> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test basic 1023

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test basic 65535

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test basic 1048575
 
<br/>

#### Packed Accountable Scheme
> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test packed 1023

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test packed 65535

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test packed 1048575

<br/>

#### Counting Scheme
> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test counting 1023

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test counting 65535

> cargo test --release --features "parallel print-trace" --test counting 1048575

<br/>

The output should look, for example, like this (single-threaded, `--test basic 1023`; timings are machine-dependent)
