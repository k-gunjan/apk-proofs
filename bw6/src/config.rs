//! Curve configurations, and the API the crate is meant to be used through.
//!
//! An APK proof is parameterised by four things that are not independent: an inner BLS12 curve
//! carrying the signatures, an outer BW6 curve the proof is computed over, a polynomial
//! commitment scheme on the outer curve, and a set of evaluation domains for the outer curve's
//! scalar field. Only a handful of combinations are coherent — the outer curve's scalar field
//! has to be the inner curve's base field, and the domains have to match that field's structure.
//!
//! [`ApkConfig`] bundles them, so choosing a curve is naming one type rather than four, and
//! combinations that do not make sense cannot be spelled. Everything below the config —
//! [`crate::Keyset`], [`crate::Prover`], [`crate::Verifier`], the PIOP — carries a single type
//! parameter, and [`Apk`] hides even that:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use apk_proofs::{Apk381, Bitmask};
//! # let pks: Vec<ark_bls12_381::G1Projective> = unimplemented!();
//! # let bitmask: Bitmask = unimplemented!();
//! # use apk_proofs::setup::InsecureSetup;
//! let rng = &mut ark_std::test_rng();
//! // Insecure source: samples the trapdoor locally, so tests only (`test-utils`). Production
//! // parameters must come from a trusted-setup ceremony; see `crate::setup`.
//! let setup = Apk381::setup(&mut InsecureSetup::new(rng), 1000).unwrap(); // validators, not log2(anything)
//! let (keyset, commitment) = Apk381::commit_keyset(&setup, pks)?;
//! let (proof, public_input) = Apk381::prove(&setup, keyset, &commitment, bitmask)?;
//! assert!(Apk381::verify(&setup, commitment, &public_input, &proof)?);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
