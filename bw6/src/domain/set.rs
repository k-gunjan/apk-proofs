//! The triple of evaluation domains the PIOP works over, and the two ways of producing it.
//!
//! The protocol needs three domains: the trace domain `H` of size `n`, and two larger ones that
//! hold products of register polynomials in evaluation form. The constraint polynomial has
//! degree up to `4n - 3`, so recovering it takes at least `4n - 2` evaluations.
//!
//! The protocol's demand on the two larger domains is only capacity — `2n - 1` and `4n - 2`
//! points — and that is all this module states. Which sizes a field actually offers, and how it
//! reaches them from `n`, is left to the [`DomainSizes`] table the configuration supplies.
//! Everything downstream — [`crate::Keyset`], [`crate::domains::Domains`], the PIOP, the prover
//! and the verifier — carries a single `D: DomainSet` parameter and never asks which curve it
//! is on.
